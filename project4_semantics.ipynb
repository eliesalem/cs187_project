    "The goal of semantic parsing is to convert natural language utterances to a meaning representation such as a _logical form_ expression or a _SQL query_. In the previous project segment, you built a parsing system to reconstruct parse trees from the natural-language queries in the ATIS dataset. However, that only solves an intermediary task, not the end-user task of obtaining answers to the queries.\n",

    "In this final project segment, you will go further, building a semantic parsing system to convert English queries to SQL queries, so that by consulting a database you will be able to answer those questions. You will implement both a rule-based approach and an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) approach. Both algorithms come with their pros and cons, and by the end of this segment you should have a basic understanding of the characteristics of the two approaches. \n",

For this query, we will go through what the possible meaning representations for the subconstituents of \"flights to boston\" might be. But this is just one way of doing things; other ways are possible, and you should feel free to experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working from bottom up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `TERM_PLACE` phrase \"boston\" uses the composition function template `constant(airports_from_city(' '.join(_RHS)))`, which will be instantiated as `constant(airports_from_city(' '.join(['boston'])))` (recall that `_RHS` is replaced by the right-hand side of the rule). The meaning of `TERM_PLACE` will be the SQL snippet\n",

    "```\n",
    "(This query generates a list of all of the airports in Boston.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `N_PLACE` phrase \"boston\" can have the same meaning as the `TERM_PLACE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `P_PLACE` phrase \"to\" might be associated with a function that maps a SQL query for a list of airports to a SQL condition that holds of flights that go to one of those airports, i.e., `flight.to_airport IN (...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `PP_PLACE` phrase \"to boston\" might apply the `P_PLACE` meaning to the `TERM_PLACE` meaning, thus generating a SQL condition that holds of flights that go to one of the Boston airports:\n",
    "```\n",
    "flight.to_airport IN\n",
    "    (SELECT airport_service.airport_code \n",
    "     FROM airport_service \n",
    "     WHERE airport_service.city_code IN\n",
    "         (SELECT city.city_code \n",
    "          FROM city \n",
    "          WHERE city.city_name = \"BOSTON\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `PP` phrase \"to Boston\" can again get its meaning from the `PP_PLACE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The `TERM_FLIGHT` phrase \"flights\" might also return a condition on flights, this time the \"null condition\", represented by the SQL truth value `1`. Ditto for the `N_FLIGHT` phrase \"flights\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The `N_FLIGHT` phrase \"flights to boston\" can conjoin the two conditions, yielding the SQL condition\n",
    "```\n",
    "flight.to_airport IN\n",
    "    (SELECT airport_service.airport_code \n",
    "     FROM airport_service \n",
    "     WHERE airport_service.city_code IN\n",
    "         (SELECT city.city_code \n",
    "          FROM city \n",
    "          WHERE city.city_name = \"BOSTON\"))\n",
    "AND 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "which can be inherited by the `NOM_FLIGHT` and `NP_FLIGHT` phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The `S` phrase \"flights to boston\" can use the condition provided by the `NP_FLIGHT` phrase to select all flights satisfying the condition with a SQL query like\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT flight.flight_id\n",
    "FROM flight\n",
    "WHERE flight.to_airport IN\n",
    "        (SELECT airport_service.airport_code \n",

    "      AND 1\n",

    "We can perform a more systematic evaluation by checking the accuracy of the queries on an entire test set for which we have gold queries. The `evaluate` function below does just this, calculating precision, recall, and F1 metrics for the test set. It takes as argument a \"predictor\" function, which maps token sequences to predicted SQL queries. We've provided a predictor function for the rule-based model in the next cell (and a predictor for the seq2seq system below when we get to that system).\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule-based system does not generate predictions for all queries; many queries won't parse. The precision and recall metrics take this into account in measuring the efficacy of the method. The recall metric captures what proportion of _all of the test examples_ for which the system generates a correct query. The precision metric captures what proportion of _all of the test examples for which a prediction is generated_ for which the system generates a correct query. (Recall that F1 is just the geometric mean of precision and recall.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've made some progress on adding augmentations to the grammar, you can evaluate your progress by seeing if the precision and recall have improved. For reference, the solution code achieves precision of about 66% and recall of about 28% for an F1 of 39%."

    "## Goal 3: Implement a seq2seq model (with cross attention and self attention)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, you have implemented a seq2seq model with attention. The attention mechanism used in that section is usually referred to as \"cross-attention\", as at each decoding step, the decoder attends to encoder outputs, enabling a dynamic view on the encoder side as decoding proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can have a dynamic view on the decoder side as well as decoding proceeds, i.e., the decoder attends to decoder outputs at previous steps. This is called \"self attention\", and has been found very useful in modern neural architectures such as transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Augment the seq2seq model you implemented before with a decoder self-attention mechanism as class `AttnEncoderDecoder2`. A model diagram can be found below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/nlp-course/data/raw/master/img/encoderdecoder_attn_selfattn.png\" alt=\"encoder-decoder-attn-with-selfattn illustration\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "At each decoding step, the decoder LSTM first produces an output state $o_t$, then it attends to all previous output states $o_1, \\ldots, o_{t-1}$ (decoder self-attention). You need to special case the first decoding step to not perform self-attention, as there are no previous decoder states. The attention result is added to $o_t$ itself and the sum is used as $q_t$ to attend to the encoder side (encoder-decoder cross-attention). The rest of the model is the same as encoder-decoder with attention.\n"

    "## (Optional) Goal 4: Use state-of-the-art pretrained transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent breakthrough in natural-language processing stems from the use of pretrained transformer models. For example, you might have heard of pretrained transformers such as [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). (BERT is already used in [Google search](https://searchengineland.com/google-bert-used-on-almost-every-english-query-342193).) These models are usually trained on vast amounts of text data using variants of language modeling objectives, and researchers have found that finetuning them on downstream tasks usually results in better performance as compared to training a model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous part, you implemented an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence approach. To \"upgrade\" the model to be a state-of-the-art pretrained transformer only requires minor modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pretrained model that we will use is [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461), which uses a bidirectional transformer encoder and a unidirectional transformer decoder, as illustrated in the below diagram (image courtesy https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13461):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlp-course/data/master/img/bart_architecture.png\" alt=\"encoder-decoder illustration\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that this model is strikingly similar to the LSTM-based encoder-decoder model we've been using. The only difference is that they use transformers instead of LSTMs. Therefore, we only need to change the modeling parts of the code, as we will see later."

    "Project segment notebooks are manually graded, not autograded using otter as labs are. (Otter is used within project segment notebooks to synchronize distribution and solution code however.) **We will not run your notebook before grading it.** Instead, we ask that you submit the already freshly run notebook. The best method is to \"restart kernel and run all cells\", allowing time for all cells to be run to completion. You should submit your code to Gradescope at the code submission assignment at <http://go.cs187.info/project4-submit-code>. Make sure that you are also submitting your `data/grammar` file as part of your solution code as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also request that you **submit a PDF of the freshly run notebook**. The simplest method is to use \"Export notebook to PDF\", which will render the notebook to PDF via LaTeX. If that doesn't work, the method that seems to be most reliable is to export the notebook as HTML (if you are using Jupyter Notebook, you can do so using `File -> Print Preview`), open the HTML in a browser, and print it to a file. Then make sure to add the file to your git commit. Please name the file the same name as this notebook, but with a `.pdf` extension. (Conveniently, the methods just described will use that name by default.) You can then perform a git commit and push and submit the commit to Gradescope at <http://go.cs187.info/project4-submit-pdf>.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you submit the PDF to Gradescope, make sure to **assign to each question in the outline the corresponding pages in the PDF**. You can refer to the official Gradescope documentation for instructions on assigning pages at <https://go.cs187.info/assignpages>. Submissions without assigned pages are subject to a score deduction."
