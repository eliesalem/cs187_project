The `evaluate` function below does just this, calculating precision, recall, and F1 metrics for the test set. It takes as argument a \"predictor\" function, which maps token sequences to predicted SQL queries.

The precision and recall metrics take this into account in measuring the efficacy of the method. The recall metric captures what proportion of _all of the test examples_ for which the system generates a correct query. The precision metric captures what proportion of _all of the test examples for which a prediction is generated_ for which the system generates a correct query. (Recall that F1 is just the geometric mean of precision and recall.)\n",

You need to special case the first decoding step to not perform self-attention, as there are no previous decoder states. The attention result is added to $o_t$ itself and the sum is used as $q_t$ to attend to the encoder side (encoder-decoder cross-attention).

For example, you might have heard of pretrained transformers such as [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). (BERT is already used in [Google search](https://searchengineland.com/google-bert-used-on-almost-every-english-query-342193).) These models are usually trained on vast amounts of text data using variants of language modeling objectives, and researchers have found that finetuning them on downstream tasks usually results in better performance as compared to training a model from scratch.\n",

        "Rule-based systems generally require more manual effort upfront but allow for rapid testing and iteration. The development process involves carefully crafting rules, which can be tedious but provides immediate feedback. In contrast, neural approaches demand significant computational resources and time for training and debugging, making the development cycle longer and potentially more frustrating.\n",
        "\n",
        "The performance characteristics of these approaches reveal distinct trade-offs. Rule-based systems typically achieve higher precision but lower recall – meaning they're more accurate when they make predictions but may fail to handle many valid inputs. Neural approaches tend to show more balanced but moderate performance across metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice between these approaches largely depends on the application context. For critical systems where errors could have serious consequences, rule-based approaches might be preferable due to their higher precision and predictability. However, in applications where occasional inaccuracies are acceptable and the ability to handle diverse inputs is paramount, neural approaches could be more suitable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability is a crucial consideration. While rule-based systems can be effective for well-defined, limited domains, they become increasingly difficult to maintain as the scope expands. Neural approaches, despite their initial complexity, often scale better to handle broader input variations and evolving requirements.\n",

You should submit your code to Gradescope at the code submission assignment at <http://go.cs187.info/project4-submit-code>. Make sure that you are also submitting your `data/grammar` file as part of your solution code as well.\n",

Then make sure to add the file to your git commit. Please name the file the same name as this notebook, but with a `.pdf` extension. (Conveniently, the methods just described will use that name by default.)
